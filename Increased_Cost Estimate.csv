"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,,
Narrative: I increased the Instances on both the RDS and EC2’s. I included an Provisioned IOPS of 5000 on the RDS so the db will be lightning fast. I didn’t increase anything else because those wouldn’t be needed. I believe just increasing the RDS and the EC2 was what needed to be done to make the site faster.,,,,,,,,,
